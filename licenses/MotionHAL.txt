revocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license during the term of this Agreement, without the right to sublicense:
(A)       under Intel's copyrights and (subject to the third party licensing requirements reflected herein, if any) Intel's suppliers' 
copyrights, to: 
(1)       reproduce and publicly perform a Binary Code representation of the Software provided or otherwise made available

Device, subject to the third party licensing requirements reflected herein, if any;
(2)       distribute a Binary Code representation of the Software or of any Derivatives, with or to an Intel-based Device solely 
for execution by an  Intel-based Device, and if to an End User, pursuant to a license agreement with terms and 
conditions at least as restrictive as those contained in the Intel End User Software License Agreement attached as 
Exhibit A;
(3)       prepare derivative works of, reproduce and distribute any End-User documentation that may accompany the

(4)       reproduce any Documentation that may accompany the Software and distribute such Documentation in association 
with the Intel-based Device, solely in accordance with confidentiality obligations; 
(B)       under Intel's Licensed Patent Claims to the Software in the form provided by Intel, to:
(1)       reproduce the Software internally only;

conditions at least as restrictive as those contained in Intel's End User Software License Agreement attached as 
Exhibit A, and only for use in or with Intel-based Devices; and
(b)       provided, further, that the license under the Licensed Patent Claims does not and will not apply to any 
modifications to, or derivative works (including Derivatives) of, the Software, whether made by or on behalf of 
Licensee, by any of Licensee's customers (which, for all purposes under this Agreement, will mean either a 
customer or a distributor), or any other third party even if the modifications and derivative works (including 
Derivatives) are authorized under Section (A) above. 
LICENSE LIMITATIONS.
(A)       All right, title and interest in and to the Software and associated Documentation are and will remain the exclusive property 
of Intel and its suppliers, as applicable. Unless expressly permitted under the Limited License, above, Licensee will not, and 
will not allow any third party to:
(1)       use, copy or distribute the Software or associated Documentation; 
(2)       modify, adapt, enhance, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, change or create derivative works from the 
Software, except and only to the extent as specifically required by mandatory applicable laws or any applicable third 
party software license terms accompanying the Software; or 
(3)       use or make the Software available for the use or benefit of third parties. 
(B)       The consideration under this Agreement is only for the licenses that Intel expressly grants above. Any other rights including, 
but not limited to, additional patent rights, will require an additional license and additional consideration. Nothing in this 
Agreement requires or will be treated to require Intel to grant any additional license. Licensee acknowledges that an 
essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that Intel grants Licensee no licenses or other rights including, but not 
limited to, patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name, service mark or other intellectual property licenses or 
rights with respect to the Software and associated Documentation, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the 
licenses expressly granted above. Specifically, except for the licenses that Intel expressly grants above, Intel grants no 
licenses or other rights, expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, to:
(1)       make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import modifications or derivative works of the Software;
(2)       sell or offer to sell the Software;
(3)       combine the Software or modified versions or derivative works of the Software with other items or to use any such 
combination; or
(4)       any claims of any patents, patent applications, or other patent rights of Intel other than the Licensed Patent Claims.
(C)       Licensee acknowledges that there are significant uses of the Software in its original, unmodified and uncombined form. The 
consideration for the licenses in this Agreement reflects Intel's continuing right to assert patent claims against any 
modifications or derivative works (including, without limitation, error corrections and bug fixes) of, or combinations with, 
the Software that Licensee or third parties make that infringe any Intel patent claim.
(D)      Except as expressly permitted under the license grant above, Licensee will not allow the Software or associated 
Documentation to be accessed or used by third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee's Contractors may access 
the Software in Binary Code and associated Documentation where the access is necessary to their performing services on 
Licensee's behalf, consistent with the licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement, provided:
(1)       Licensee first requires those Contractors to sign written agreements obligating them to observe the same restrictions 
concerning the Software and associated Documentation as contained in this Agreement; 
   i and
(2)       Licensee remains fully liable to Intel for the actions and inactions of those Contractors.
FEEDBACK. Should any comments, suggestions, descriptions, ideas or any other feedback on the Software or Documentation (collectively 
"Feedback"), be provided by or on behalf of Licensee to Intel, however provided and however designated, whether written or verbal, whether 
marked or labeled, Intel will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, and license or otherwise distribute or exploit such Feedback at its sole discretion, 
without any obligations or restrictions of any kind, including without limitation, intellectual property rights or licensing obligations.
MODIFICATIONS: To ensure Intel's freedom to operate and to continue to develop the Software licensed hereunder, Licensee agrees to grant 
and does hereby grant to Intel a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, with the right 
of sublicense, to and under any copyrights, trade secrets, patents and any other intellectual property rights, whether perfected or not, to publically 
perform, publically display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute, import, copy, create derivative works of and otherwise 
exploit any derivative works, including Derivatives, created from or otherwise including the Software. 
RIGHT OF INSPECTION. At any time during the term of this Agreement, Intel has the right, by giving Licensee reasonable notice to have an 
independent auditor inspect Licensee's relevant records to verify Licensee's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
Should the inspection reveal any material non-compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Intel has the right terminate this Agreement and 
all licenses granted hereunder.
OPEN SOURCE STATEMENT. The Software includes Open Source Software that is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source Software 
license agreement(s) identified in the Open Source Software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header(s) provided with 
or otherwise associated with the Software. Additional detail may be provided (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation, 
or within the user interface of the device, if any. With respect to Open Source Software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or 
grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source Software license agreement. Neither Licensee nor any OEM, ODM, 
customer, or distributor, will subject the Software or associated Documentation, in whole or in part, to any license obligations associated with 
Open Source Software including combining or distributing the Software and/or Documentation with Open Source Software in a manner that 
subjects Intel or any portion of the Software to any license obligations of such Open Source Software.
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. Certain third party software provided with or within the Software may only be used (a) upon securing a commercial 
license directly from the owner of the software unless explicitly stated otherwise in a document attached to this Agreement or attached to the 
software, or (b) in combination with silicon purchased from such third party.
CONFIDENTIALITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, the exchange of Confidential Information, as well as the Software and 
associated Documentation are subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement by and between Intel and 
Licensee (CNDA) in force between the parties. If Licensee would like to have a Contractor perform work on Licensee's behalf that involves 
access to or use of Software, Licensee will obtain a written confidentiality agreement from the Contractor which contains terms and conditions 
with respect to access to or use of Software no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement and the CNDA, and excluding any 
distribution rights and use for any other purpose, and Licensee will remain fully liable to Intel for the actions and inactions of those Contractors. 
Otherwise, Licensee must not disclose the terms or existence of this Agreement, and must not use Intel's name in any publications, 
advertisements, or other announcements without Intel's prior written consent. Licensee does not have any right to use any Intel trademarks or 
logos.
OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE AND COPYRIGHTS. Title to all copies of the Software and associated Documentation remains with Intel or its 
suppliers, as applicable. The Software is copyrighted and protected by the laws of the United States and other countries, and international 
treaty provisions. Licensee may not remove any copyright notices from the Software or associated Documentation.
SUPPORT. Intel may make changes to the Software, or to items referenced therein, at any time without notice, but is not obligated to support, 
update or provide training for the Software. Intel may in its sole discretion offer such services under separate terms at Intel's then-current 
rates. Licensee may request additional information on Intel's service offerings from an Intel sales representative. Licensee agrees to be solely 
responsible to Licensee's End Users for any update or support obligation or other liability which may arise from the distribution of the 
Software.
EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Intel does not warrant or assume 
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information, text, graphics, links or other items contained within the Software.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL INTEL OR ITS AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, 
EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS 
INTERRUPTION, OR LOST INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY IN PART 
NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THE SOFTWARE 
LICENSED HEREUNDER IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY MEDICAL, LIFE SAVING OR LIFE SUSTAINING SYSTEMS, 
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, NUCLEAR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATION IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE 
SOFTWARE COULD LEAD TO PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH. LICENSEE WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD INTEL AND ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS 
(INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) HARMLESS AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, 
DAMAGES, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES), ARISING OUT OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE 
SOFTWARE AND ANY CLAIM OF PRODUCT LIABILITY, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH ANY UNINTENDED USE, EVEN IF SUCH 
CLAIM ALLEGES THAT INTEL OR AN INTEL AFFILIATE OR SUPPLIER WAS NEGLIGENT REGARDING THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE 
SOFTWARE. THE LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE 
BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL AND LICENSEE. AND INTEL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. 
TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. Upon notice, Intel may terminate this Agreement immediately, if Licensee violates any of its terms or 
conditions. Upon termination, Licensee will immediately destroy the Software (including providing certification of such destruction back to 
Intel) or return all copies of the Software to Intel. In the event of termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to Licensee hereunder 
terminate immediately.

ASSIGNMENT. Licensee may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license(s) granted or any of Licensee's rights or duties 
hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Licensee is the surviving entity) or 
acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without Intel's express prior written consent, will be null and void. Intel may assign, 
delegate and transfer this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion. 
ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The terms and conditions of this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its 
subject matter, and merge and supersede all prior, contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. Neither of 
the parties hereto will be bound by any conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or representations with respect to this subject 
matter other than as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Intel is not obligated under any other agreement unless it is in writing and 
signed by an authorized representative of Intel. Without limiting the foregoing, terms and conditions on any purchase orders or similar 
materials submitted by Licensee to Intel, and any terms contained in Intel's standard acknowledgment form that are in conflict with these 
terms, will be of no force or effect with respect to the Software. 
ATTORNEY'S FEES. In the event any proceeding or lawsuit is brought by Intel or Licensee in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party 
in such proceeding will be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys' fees, including costs and fees on appeal. 
NO AGENCY. No agency, franchise, partnership, joint-venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. 
SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by 
applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such 
event, such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within 
the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions. 
WAIVER. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof will not affect the full right to require 
such performance at any time thereafter; nor will the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver 
of the provision itself. 
LANGUAGE. This Agreement is in the English language only, which language is controlling in all respects, and all versions of this Agreement in 
any other language are for accommodation only and will not be binding on Licensee or Intel. All communications and notices made or given
